# Welcome to the Before the Hack (BtH) Ruleset Database! 
This open-source project is designed to enhance your Suricata intrusion prevention system by providing a unique set of rules specifically crafted to detect and mitigate potential threats before they lead to a compromise.

## Usage
- Download the BtH database (bth.rules)
- Edit the /etc/suricata/suricata.yaml
-- Add the path for bth.rules to the 'Rules' section

## Features
- Proactive Threat Detection: Unlike traditional rule databases that focus on identifying exploits as they occur, the BtH ruleset is engineered to anticipate and detect potential threats before they can exploit vulnerabilities.
- Custom-Built Rules: Our rules are meticulously developed based on emerging threat intelligence and attack patterns to ensure early detection and prevention.
- Open-Source and Community-Driven: As with Suricata, this project benefits from community contributions and feedback. We encourage collaboration and welcome contributions to refine and expand our ruleset.

## Benefits
- Early Threat Mitigation: Gain an edge in your cybersecurity strategy by identifying and blocking threats before they can exploit your systems.
- Enhanced Security Posture: Complement your existing rule sets with our pre-emption rules to build a more robust defense mechanism.
- Regular Updates: Stay ahead of new and evolving threats with frequent updates based on the latest threat intelligence.
