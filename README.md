# Detecting Threats before Compromise
Many rulesets available for IDS/IPS software, such as Suricata and Snort, can easily identify exploits. The BTH database aims to detect and alert on malicious traffic before a compromise occurs. Rules detailed in the BTH database are built to detect common red-team security tools such as Responder and Nmap.
