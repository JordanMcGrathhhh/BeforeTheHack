# Detecting Threats before Compromise
Many rulesets available for IDS/IPS software, such as Suricata, can easily identify exploits. The BTH database aims to detect and alert on malicious traffic before a compromise occurs. Catching signs of malicious traffic early provides security teams more time to investigate, prepare additional defenses, and begin the incident response process sooner.
